# Tratchun Visualization Data

This is my version of an exercise of the course "Microsoft Power BI – Curso de Power BI Desktop" from Udemy, and part of the course "Inteligencia Artificial y Análisis de Datos con PowerBI" from Guayerd + IBM.

To use this report, you need to change all the tables data and images sources to your own data sources, using Advance Editor.
